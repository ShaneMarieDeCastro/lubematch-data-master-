  "marketing": "Quaker State^Â® SAE 0W-20 is a full synthetic motor oil formulated to resist breakdown and deliver engine protection and performance. Whether driving your vehicle in stop-and-go traffic or pulling heavy loads, hard-working vehicles experience stress that can break down oil and lead to friction-related wear. The oil meets or exceeds the engine protection required by API SP and ILSAC GF-6A, and is specially formulated to provide  protection against the harmful effects of stop-and-go driving and high and low-temperature engine operation, resisting thermal breakdown of the oil.",
