  "marketing": "Shell Fully Formulated Phosphate Free Coolant/Antifreeze is a conventional, single-phase, ethylene glycol based heavy-duty diesel engine coolant which contains silicate, nitrite and molybdate. This coolant does not contain phosphate, which meets the phosphate free requirements of European engine OEMs. This product is not an extended life coolant and requires regular additions of SCA’s in order to provide complete cooling system protection. Shell Fully Formulated Phosphate Free Coolant/Antifreeze is compatible with commercially available supplemental coolant additives and meets TMC RP 329 and ASTM D6210. This product contains an initial dose of supplemental coolant additives (SCA’s) and thus is ready to use as an initial fill and top-up fluid. Use of a fully formulated coolant for top-up may help reduce the number of SCA treatments required over the coolant’s life. Commercially available test strips can be used with this product to determine when additional SCA’s must be added. Do not use this product where OEM specification requires the use of a coolant/antifreeze meeting CAT EC-1 or International Truck and Engine B1 Type III.",
