  "marketing": "Shell Fire Resistant HFA is a high-water hydraulic fluid that has a specially formulated thickener that naturally forms a colloid when placed into water. Shell Fire Resistant HFA has the environmental benefits of being a high water based hydraulic fluid and the improved hydraulic control obtained with higher viscosity than what can be obtained with other HFA fluids.",
