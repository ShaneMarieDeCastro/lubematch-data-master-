  "marketing": "Because it is made entirely with synthetic base stocks, Quaker State^® Full Synthetic Gear Lubricant offers excellent performance when subjected to temperature extremes – both high and low – for year-round protection under a variety of conditions. It is especially effective in vehicles operating under severe conditions, such as towing a boat, trailer or other vehicles. It is also effective in promoting smooth shifting of manual transmissions and transaxles where extreme low temperatures are a concern. The synthetic base, combined with advanced additive technology, offers outstanding resistance to oxidation for long lubricant life and minimal deposit formation for clean gear operation.",
