  "marketing": "Shell Turbo Revive is a synthetic based solvency enhancer, that can be incorporated into hydrocarbon-based turbine fluids to reduce the issues associated with varnish formation and product instability. Shell Turbo Revive is designed improve the solubility of pre-existing hydrocarbon-based turbine fluid in order to repair those fluids with elevated and high varnish potential ratings. \nShell Turbo Revive does not replenish the existing anti-oxidants in used turbine fluids but rather helps re-activate the additives that are trapped in varnish deposits by bringing them back into solution.",
