  "marketing": "Shell Gadus S2 Steel Spindle Grease is specifically designed to meet the challenges of moderate and low speed couplings (<1000 RPMs). The product is designed to lubricate heavily loaded spindles and couplings commonly found in steel mill drives. The solid additives facilitate the sliding contact in mechanical couplings due lateral movement due to shaft expansion or mechanical misalignment. The product is uniquely formulated with a combination lithium / polymer thickener system that resists separation due to centrifugal forces experienced by standard greases in these applications.",
