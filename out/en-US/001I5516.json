Shell Water Glycol S2 C 32 was developed and designed specifically to operate at system pressures of 2000-4000 psi depending on pump type (vane or piston).  The formulation contains more than a sufficient amount of water to prevent the propagation of fire in the event of a hydraulic line rupture near an ignition source.",
