  "marketing": "Shell EcoSafe Revive is a synthetic based solvency enhancer, that can be incorporated into hydrocarbon-based, non-zinc turbine fluids to reduce the issues associated with varnish formation and product instability. Shell EcoSafe Revive is designed improve the solubility of pre-existing hydrocarbon-based turbine fluid in order to assist in mitigation of those fluids with elevated and high varnish potential ratings. Shell EcoSafe Revive does not replenish the existing anti-oxidants in used turbine fluids but rather helps by re-solubilizing additives that are trapped in varnish deposits.",
