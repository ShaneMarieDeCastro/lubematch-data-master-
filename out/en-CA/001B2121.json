  "marketing": "Molybdenum disulfide is added to reduce friction and wear and achieve optimum load carrying capability. This grease meets latest automotive requirements, including long intervals of lubrication service. It remains plastic and adhesive to protect all types of bearings, splines, torsion bar bushings and universal joints where extreme pressures are often a problem. A substantial increase in the life of both parts and the lubricant can be achieved through the use of PENNZOIL^® MULTI-PURPOSE 302 EP GREASE WITH MOLY. ",
