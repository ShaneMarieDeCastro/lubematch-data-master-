  "marketing": "Shell Omala S3 Wind is a mineral oil based industrial gear lubricant offering high performance in wind turbine gearbox applications. It has been specifically designed to efficiently operate in low temperatures, assures excellent wear protection under high loads and shock load conditions, guards against micropitting and offers a high level of cleanliness. Please consider that use in systems with fine filtration is not recommended/supported by Shell because sustained foam control performance is not assured.",
