It is especially effective in vehicles operating under severe conditions, such as towing a boat, trailer or other vehicles. It is also effective in promoting smooth shifting of manual transmissions and transaxles where extreme low temperatures are a concern. The synthetic base, combined with advanced additive technology, offers outstanding resistance to oxidation for long lubricant life and minimal deposit formation for clean gear operation.",
