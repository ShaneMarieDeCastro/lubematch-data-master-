  "marketing": "Shell Gadus Fifth Wheel grease is a high-performance heavy-duty grease specifically formulated for the lubrication of the coupling between a vehicle used for towing and a trailer. It is based on high viscosity index mineral oil and a lithium soap thickener. It also contains solids to ensure the grease can handle shock loads and provide an effective lubricating film under the high load and constant sliding contact experienced in fifth wheels.",
